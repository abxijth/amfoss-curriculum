# Task 02: SRS

## The development process for MeloFi began with the creation of a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. This foundational document details the system's intended purpose, features, and overall requirements. It serves as a guide for the project, ensuring that all stakeholders, including developers and designers, have a clear and shared understanding of the goals and scope.

## The SRS for MeloFi provides a detailed look at the project's vision and is available in the accompanying PDF document. The key sections covered in the SRS are:

*   **Project Overview:** A high-level introduction to MeloFi.
*   **Goals:** The primary objectives the project aims to achieve.
*   **Target Users:** A description of the intended audience for the application.
*   **Core Features:** A list of the essential functionalities to be included.
*   **Basic Tech Stack:** An outline of the proposed technologies for development.
