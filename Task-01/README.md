# TASK 01: GIT

- This task was all about improving my Git skills by solving challenges from [gitexercises.fracz.com](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/).

---

## Key Takeaways

- Each exercise focused on a specific Git concept — commits, branches, merges, rebases, stashing, and much more.  

- I learned not just the commands, but also how to think in Git — how history works, how to clean it up, and how to recover from mistakes
